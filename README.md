KEY TAKEAWAYS

As another exercise on the technical aspect of web programming, this exercise was also relatively easier. I really find this lesson very useful as I feel there really are
many modules in the internet that I can use for our upcoming project here in CMSC 100.

ADDITIONAL NOTES TO THE FIC: I would just like to request copies of the files being ran during the pre-lab discussion so we can run it ourselves while it is being taught to us.
Personally, it will be really useful for me to better understand the lesson.
